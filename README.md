# tictactoe-montecarlo

This is my basic re-creation of the game Tic-Tac-Toe in the CodeSkulptor browser-based IDE, which was created by the Rice University Department of Computer Science.

Due to the highly specific nature of the GUI, it only works in CodeSkulptor - you can access it at https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user48_c1cPFDWg2h_2.py 

You will play against a bot which uses Monte Carlo simulation to determine the best move. Good luck!
